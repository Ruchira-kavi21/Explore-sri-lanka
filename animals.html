                    <h2 class="title"> Sri Lankan Elephant (Elephas maximus maximus)</h2>
                    <p class="detail">
                        Sri Lankan elephants (Elephas maximus maximus) are a subspecies of the Asian elephant and are native to the island of Sri Lanka, located in the Indian Ocean. 
                        They are one of three recognized subspecies of Asian elephants, the others being the Indian elephant and the Sumatran elephant.
                        Sri Lankan elephants inhabit a variety of environments, including grasslands, forests, and wetlands. They can be found in both lowland and montane areas of the island.
                        Survival in national parks relies on the availability of water, food, and suitable habitats. 
                        Water sources such as tanks, rivers, and reservoirs are crucial for the elephants, especially during the dry season. 
                        Conservation efforts focus on protecting these habitats and ensuring the availability of corridors for elephants to move between different areas.
                        <br><br>
                        Sri Lanka's elephants thrive in parks like Minneriya National Park, Udawalawe National Park, Kaudulla National Park, Yala National Park, Wilpattu National Park, Wasgamuwa National Park, and Gal Oya National Park. These habitats attract large herds, especially during dry seasons, offering unique wildlife experiences. Conservation efforts aim to safeguard their presence in these vital ecosystems.
